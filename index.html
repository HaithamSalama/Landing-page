        <h2>Public Scrutinise</h2>
        <p>Demands for transparency are central to the current culture of public debate. Climate scientists and their
          associations, the former English football captain, individual politicians and political parties, arts
          organisations, BBC broadcasters, financial institutions, and local government have all been criticised in the
          past few days for not being transparent enough. This has led to demands for transparency of that entity we used to call the private
          citizen.</p>

        <p>The controversies about hacked e-mails, withheld climate change data, and the scientific veracity of some
          predictions of environmental damage have encouraged an unhealthy kind of cynicism, suspicious of all
          information regardless of its sources.</p>

        <h2>London Olympics </h2>
        <p>The Chinese are profoundly rethinking what a Gold medal means. In the past several decades, it was hugely
          exciting for the Chinese to obtain a gold medal, primarily because we paid much more attention to winning than
          other countries. It encouraged us to try our best to win the gold even though it almost guaranteed that there
          would be cruel personal sacrifices needed to attain it. But it worked. Now China is a clear winner and cannot
          be ignored any longer.</p>

        <p>There is also a large number of Chinese people who take it to extremes and throw away the national interest
          completely. This makes those who think that athletes should fight for their country, fight to be first—the
          very basis of competitive sport—quite angry.</p>

        <h2>Social Media</h2>
        <p>First, I should mention Buffer, a tool that allows you to post on Twitter, Facebook, and other social media
          platforms in advance. It is also an analytical program that allows you to see what activity you got on certain
          posts and what time is the best to post. It also has a browser extension for easy posting. It has become a
          respected name in social media management.
          <br>
          You know those long links you want to post on your profiles and that look awkward? You can shorten them
          effectively with Bit.ly. This comes in handy especially for Twitter with its 140-character limit.
          <br>
          If you want to find business leads through social media, the application Oktopost focuses on just that. You
          can also manage your social media accounts through it. It is the most comprehensive business-to-business
          social media management system. </p>
